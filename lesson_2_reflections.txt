What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	a folder is created called ".git".
	I need to do it to make it a git repository and start making commits and tracking my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a place to hold tracked files which are ready to be commited.
	It enables me to track my files and review my commits before making them.
