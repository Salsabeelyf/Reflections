What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	pros:
		Automatic merges saves me time for comparing files that were changed in different branches.

		Also if the changed file was contained code, automatic merging may result in bugs that won't cause merge conflicts but make the code not work properly.
