When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When i am working on the same project with a group of people and i want to share all the updates with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This may save space on my local directory.
