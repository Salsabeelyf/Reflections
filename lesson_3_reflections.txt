When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When i am working on the same project with a group of people and i want to share all the updates with them.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This may save space on my local directory.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    fork: clones a repository to another one only on GitHub.
    clone: clones a repository from GitHub to the local machine.
    branches: makes two versions of code so different changes can be made to one without affecting the other,

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	By fetching and having a local copy of the last known state of the remote, i can take a look at the changes in it before i decide whether to merge it with my local master branch or not.
